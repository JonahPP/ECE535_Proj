Project Ideas: 4. Deep-Learning based Tracking for Mobile Systems

# Motivation
The motivation to take this project is profound recognition of the transformative potential of deep learning in advancing mobile tracking systems. As living in era where similar technologies demand percise pose estimation, it is interest to work on this project. By working on this project we are looking forward to contribute to the forefront of technological innovation and improvement.

# Design Goals
Our goal is to develop deep learning tracking algorithm for two mobile systems.

# Deliverables
- Implement and understand an end-to-end learning approach for tracking - TartaVO
- Benchmark TartanVO on two datasets to evaulate its performance (data & code provided)
- Analyze performance difference across datasets and reason about it
